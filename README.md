### SUMMARY ###

We have made available here a series of scripts to process scRNA and TCR sequencing data coming from three different volunteers vaccinated with SARS-Cov-2 mRNA vaccine. Each 10X sample represents a donor: skin-infiltrating CD45+ cells after a skin biopsy/digestion twenty-four hours after an IDT with the Moderna vaccine. 
The scripts are primarily intended as reference for manuscript "Intradermal skin test with mRNA vaccines as a surrogate marker of T cell immunity in immunosuppressed patients" rather than a stand-alone application.


These scripts were run on a Linux machine.

### INSTALL ###


The jupyter notebook can be run after installing the following Python libraries (using Python 3.9.12):
- scanpy 1.9.1
- scirpy 0.9.0 
- pandas 1.3.2
- bbknn 1.5.1 
- numpy 1.21.2 
- matplotlib 3.4.3
- seaborn 0.11.2  
- anndata 0.8.0
- scipy 1.8.1
- celltypist 0.1.9 


The Java scripts were run using Java JDK 15 https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html



### PIPELINE ###

The execution of the jupyter notebooks generate the different figures and files used for the publication (creation of 'analysis_out_10X' folder with related files). 

The java scripts were used to convert scirpy AIRR file to a more complete AIRR file format (with full VDJ nucleotidic and protein sequences) and to find SARS-Cov-2 specific clonotypes using MIRA and vdjdb databases.

All the files generated by the Java scripts can be found in the 'processed_files' folder.

The output files produced by cellranger can be found into 'cellranger_out' folder. Raw data are available at ADD THE GEO ACCESSION NUMBER HERE!
